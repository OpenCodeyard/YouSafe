## 1. <a name="purpose"></a> Purpose

*	The primary goal is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. 
*	As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, 
	sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).
*	This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.
*	We invite all those who participate in open source contributions to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. <a name="open-source-citizenship"></a> Open Source Citizenship

*	A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging 
	participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.
* 	Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.
*	If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to 
	contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## 3. <a name="conflict-resolution"></a> Conflict resolution

*	When multiple contributors disagree on the direction for a particular patch or the general direction of the project, the conflict should be resolved by communication. 
	The people who disagree should get together, try to understand each other's points of view, and work to find a design that addresses everyone's concerns. This is 
	usually sufficient to resolve issues. If you cannot come to an agreement, ask for the advice of one of the mantainers of the team.
*	Be wary of agreement by attrition, where one person argues a point repeatedly until other participants give up in the interests of moving on. 
	This is not conflict resolution, as it does not address everyone's concerns. 
*	Be wary of agreement by compromise, where two good competing solutions are merged into one mediocre solution. 
*	A conflict is addressed when the participants agree that the final solution is _better_ than all the conflicting proposals. 
	Sometimes the solution is more work than either of the proposals.
	
## 4. <a name="questions"></a> Questions
* 	Never be hisitent to ask questions, doubts or any tiny/huge queries regarding any content you deal with. 
*	Not everyone is an expert in all the domains and we all keep learning by observing, asking questions and making mistakes and learning from those and not repeating them.
*	Once you find your answers amd get your queries resolved, try to document it so that some other wandering member does not climb the same old mountain of queries you dealt with. 
*	This helps to save time and will help you too when you come accross such documentations in future which will save your day hopefully.
