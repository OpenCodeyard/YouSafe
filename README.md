**Problem Statement:** When there is no one to go to in times of danger or trouble, there is nowhere to seek help from, like the police or any force of authority that might help in the situation.

### Why do we need this App?
- We have seen a lot of times the crimes happening while travelling alone, hence it becomes a necessity of the situation that we need something that gives safety to us and assurance to our loved ones that we are safe and sound and can seek help from them whenever needed.
- We are using flutter to make this application so we are solving the problem of making separate applications for ios and android users 
- Many existing applications are either having issues which we gotÂ to know during the research like the application do not have an impressive and user-friendly UI, when sending SMSs it charges money, there are bugs because of which it becomes difficult to use,the application asks for too much of user information.

> _**Our Mission: Everyone should feel safe on having this App on their Smart phones whenever they step out of their houses.**_
